# Conspiracy Trajectory Analysis App
## 📄 Overview
Welcome to the Conspiracy Trajectory Analysis App! This tool is designed to help our research team view the trajectories of different users and take detailed notes. The app simplifies the process of analysing social media content, helping us gather insights on topics such as conspiracy theories, misinformation, and public discourse. All critical information is stored on Google Drive, and users must have their Google Drive synchronised with their laptop before using the app.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **User Trajectory Viewing:** Easily track and analyse the progression of different users’ posts over time.
- **Integrated Google Drive Access:** Seamlessly access and synchronise data from your Google Drive folder. Ensure the correct folder is selected at the start of each session.
- **Note-Taking Capabilities:** Take detailed notes on specific posts and participants, with options for general or post-specific observations.
- **Local Data Backup:** If you forget to click “Send Data”, your work is saved locally and can be sent later.
- **Chrome-Only Compatibility:** The app can only be used on Chrome. [Download Chrome here](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

## 📝 Getting Started
1. **Sync Google Drive:**
   - Ensure your Google Drive is synchronised with your laptop. Here’s a quick guide:
     - Install Google Drive for Desktop if you haven’t already.
     - Log in with your Google account.
     - Choose the folders you want to sync with your computer.
     - Wait for the sync process to complete before opening the app.
2. **Select the Folder:** Upon opening the app, select the synced Google Drive folder containing the dataset. Do not copy the files elsewhere, as this will prevent synchronisation with the team’s data.
3. **Set Up Your Profile:** Create a profile with your name. The app will automatically generate your user profile.
4. **Start Analysing:** Begin exploring the dataset and taking notes.

## 💻 Navigation
The app consists of four main screens:
1. **Welcome Screen:** Select the Google Drive folder and, if not already done, set up your user profile.
2. **User Dataset:** Displays the entire dataset. Participants for whom you’ve already taken notes are highlighted in yellow. Click on any row to view that participant’s data.
3. **Trajectory Data:** Provides an overview of all posts for the selected user. Click on individual rows to view specific posts.
4. **Post View:** Shows a summary of the selected post, including links. You can take notes on the post or leave general notes about the participant.

If you refresh or reload the app, you will need to reselect the Google Drive folder. The URL will remember your previous navigation, including the selected user and post. If you were on a specific post, you’ll be redirected to the general file with an option to return to the specific post.

## 🔍 Analysis Guidelines
- **Familiarise with the Data:** The current aim is to get acquainted with the dataset. Feel free to take notes on specific users or posts.
- **Save Comments:** Click “Save Comments” to ensure your notes are recorded.
- **Send Data:** When finished, click “Send Data” to upload your notes to the main folder. If you forget, your work is saved locally and can be sent later.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
