# Conspiracy Trajectory Analysis App
## üìÑ Overview
Welcome to the Conspiracy Trajectory Analysis App! This tool is designed to help our research team view the trajectories of different users and take detailed notes. The app simplifies the process of analysing social media content, helping us gather insights on topics such as conspiracy theories, misinformation, and public discourse. All critical information is stored on Google Drive, and users must have their Google Drive synchronised with their laptop before using the app.

## üöÄ Key Features
- **User Trajectory Viewing:** Easily track and analyse the progression of different users‚Äô posts over time.
- **Integrated Google Drive Access:** Seamlessly access and synchronise data from your Google Drive folder. Ensure the correct folder is selected at the start of each session.
- **Note-Taking Capabilities:** Take detailed notes on specific posts and participants, with options for general or post-specific observations.
- **Local Data Backup:** If you forget to click ‚ÄúSend Data‚Äù, your work is saved locally and can be sent later.
- **Chrome-Only Compatibility:** The app can only be used on Chrome. [Download Chrome here](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

## üìù Getting Started
1. **Sync Google Drive:**
   - Ensure your Google Drive is synchronised with your laptop. Here‚Äôs a quick guide:
     - Install Google Drive for Desktop if you haven‚Äôt already.
     - Log in with your Google account.
     - Choose the folders you want to sync with your computer.
     - Wait for the sync process to complete before opening the app.
2. **Select the Folder:** Upon opening the app, select the synced Google Drive folder containing the dataset. Do not copy the files elsewhere, as this will prevent synchronisation with the team‚Äôs data.
3. **Set Up Your Profile:** Create a profile with your name. The app will automatically generate your user profile.
4. **Start Analysing:** Begin exploring the dataset and taking notes.

## üíª Navigation
The app consists of four main screens:
1. **Welcome Screen:** Select the Google Drive folder and, if not already done, set up your user profile.
2. **User Dataset:** Displays the entire dataset. Participants for whom you‚Äôve already taken notes are highlighted in yellow. Click on any row to view that participant‚Äôs data. Trajectories that have been assigned to you will be highlighted in red.
3. **Trajectory Data:** Provides an overview of all posts for the selected user. Click on individual rows to view specific posts.
4. **Post View:** Shows a summary of the selected post, including links. You can take notes on the post or leave general notes about the participant.

If you refresh or reload the app, you will need to reselect the Google Drive folder. The URL will remember your previous navigation, including the selected user and post. If you were on a specific post, you‚Äôll be redirected to the general file with an option to return to the specific post. To return to the Home Screen and restart, click on the app logo in the top left corner or visit: [Home Screen Link](https://constancesl.github.io/conspiracyTrajectories/index.html).

## üîç Analysis Guidelines
- **Assigned trajectories:** Trajectories that have been assigned to you will be highlighted in red. This is controlled by the !ASSIGNED! tag in the Notes section. Once you have started to take notes, the row will turn orange. Feel free to remove or to keep the tag !ASSIGNED! in the notes. 
- **Completed trajectories:** Once you have taken notes on a trajectory, add the !DONE! tag to the Notes section to highlight the row in green and keep track of your progress. You can use this tag in the notes on each post to help you keep track as well if you like. 
- **Comments on posts:** For each post, take notes on the following: 
  - What is the post about?
  - What are the general themes of the conspiracy?
  - What degree of belief is the user expressing?
  - What resources are they using to support their belief?
  - Is the post a 'meta post' (reflecting on the r/conspiracy community, or the broader internet culture)?
  - Are there relevant comments to the post in light of the questions above?
  You will probably not be able to answer all of these questions for each post, but that's fine. The aim is to answer them where they are relevant. If you have found some resources that are are useful to understand the post, do copy the URL into the Notes section.
- **Comments on users:** These notes are more general and less detailed than those on posts. They should be used to capture broad patterns in the data and to keep track of information that can be useful to understand the user and their posts. They will not be used for analysis, but may be useful to contextualise your notes.
- **Formatting notes:** You can use the formatting tools in the Notes section to make your notes more readable. Use H1 and H2 for headings, and the parahraph symbol if you want to turn a heading back into a paragraph.
- **Save Comments:** Click ‚ÄúSave Comments‚Äù to ensure your notes are recorded.
- **Send Data:** When finished, click ‚ÄúSend Data‚Äù to upload your notes to the main folder. If you forget, your work is saved locally and can be sent later.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
- **Folder Selection Issues:** If you are repeatedly prompted to select a folder, ensure that your Google Drive is properly synchronised and that you‚Äôre selecting the correct folder.
- **Navigation Problems:** If you encounter issues with navigation, try refreshing the page. Remember that you will need to reselect the Google Drive folder after a refresh.
- **Feedback & Bug Reporting:** If you experience any issues, please contact support at constance.desaintlaurent@mu.ie.
